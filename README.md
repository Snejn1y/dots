## Description
This C++ program calculates the area and volume of a sphere and a spherical segment. It prompts the user to enter the coordinates and radius of a sphere and then calculates its area and volume. The program also asks the user to input the coordinates and height of a spherical segment, as well as the radius of the segment, and then calculates its area and volume.

## How to Use
To use this program, follow these steps:

Run the program.
Enter the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of the sphere.
Enter the radius of the sphere.
The program will display the area and volume of the sphere.
Enter the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of the spherical segment.
Enter the height of the spherical segment.
Enter the radius of the spherical segment.
The program will display the area and volume of the spherical segment.
The program will ask if you would like to repeat the calculations. If so, enter 1. If not, enter 0.
